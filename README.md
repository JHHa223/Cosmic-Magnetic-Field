Magnetic field data calculated by the model presented in the paper.

- Bfield_unperturbed_data.npz: B field without pressure anisotropy perturbations

- Bfield_delta[0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001]_data.npz: B field with pressure anisotropy perturbations having the amplitude 0.0001 ~ 0.1

- Bfield_damping[ll, 01, 05, 2, 10]_data.npz: B field with pressure anisotropy perturbations having different damping rates
*ll: \Gamma_{d} << \Gamma_{c}^{inst}
*01: \Gamma_{d} = 0.1\Gamma_{c}^{inst}
*05: \Gamma_{d} = 0.5\Gamma_{c}^{inst}
*2: \Gamma_{d} = 2\Gamma_{c}^{inst}
*10: \Gamma_{d} = 10\Gamma_{c}^{inst}
